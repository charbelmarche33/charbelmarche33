## 👋 Hi, my name is **[Charbel Marche](https://www.charbelmarche.com)** (@charbelmarche33)!

🎓 I am a student physician and computer scientist completing my **M.D.** and **M.S. in Data Science** at the **University of Virginia**.

👀 I’m interested in the applications of **software engineering, AI, and machine learning** in medicine, medical research, investing, and space technology.

🌱 I am part of teams developing various tools and research projects — here are a few you might find interesting:

| Project Name | Project Website | Description | Videos | Organization |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| **NovaCards.AI** | [novacards.ai](https://novacards.ai) | Co-founder of NovaCards.ai — a 2025 434 Accelerator Participant, 2022 UVA Entrepreneurship Cup Finalist, and 2022 UVA I-Corps participant. NovaCards.ai is an ML- and NLP-powered web app built by a team of student doctors to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of studying. It enables users to create and discover relevant flashcards and generate practice questions and study materials from lecture notes. | [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@novacards9634) | [NovaCards.ai GitHub Org](https://github.com/NovaCards) |
| **Anesthesia & ICU Paper Chart Digitization** | [Publication](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.09.25321925v1) | Collaborated on developing a standardized, computer-vision-ready anesthesia paper chart to facilitate digital data access in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The chart uses categorical checkboxes and structured fields to improve digitization accuracy, and the updated software demonstrated high detection accuracy for vital signs and physiological indicators. | No Demos Yet | [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Paper-Chart-Extraction-Project) |
| **Pituitary Auto-Segmentation and Normal Space Generation** | Not Publicly Hosted | Research project focused on developing accurate and automated methods for detecting and segmenting pituitary tumors using deep learning. The study aims to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes for pituitary disorders through advanced imaging analysis. | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KQH_AVEgxL1WxFkBLFipscPt-cu1cxSglMYK5p6pcy0/edit?usp=sharing) | [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Pituitary-Normal-Space) |
| **StockScrapers.com** | [stockscrapers.com](https://stockscrapers.com) | A collection of investing tools that empower retail investors to make informed decisions. Features include strategy simulation, financial modeling, and multi-company historical financial statement comparison. | [Playlist of Demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BC2CBAGCAQ&list=PLzmWbxNwcvi_1tUU0Ntrkh-9HFDHCt-JO) | [StockScrapers GitHub Org](https://github.com/StockScrapers) |
| **Stock Financial Statement Retriever From SEC** | [API Home (RapidAPI)](https://rapidapi.com/charbelmarche33-m9pHgx2tG/api/stock-financial-statement-retriever-from-sec) | The StockScrapers™ Stock Financial Statement Retriever API provides complete access to 10-K financial statement records as reported to the SEC for over 7,000 tickers, with data spanning back to 2003. Includes income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements with company metadata and source URLs. | No Demos Yet | [StockScrapers GitHub Org](https://github.com/StockScrapers) |
| **IR Quality Improvement Dashboard** | Not Publicly Hosted | Quality improvement project with UVA Health’s Interventional Radiology department. Collaborated with Jordan Bagnall and Dr. John Angle to display adverse event frequencies, severity, and trends for IR procedures over 15 years. Long-term vision includes a machine learning–based NSQIP-style risk calculator for procedural complications. | [Short Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeUTLHmubnU&t=1s) | — |
| **ICD to AIS/ISS Medical Coding Converter** | [Publication](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2356663) | Abstract accepted at SAEM 2023 and presented at multiple UVA research venues. Collaborated with Dr. Hartka to develop neural networks that predict Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes from ICD codes using PyTorch. | [Recorded Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HofUtHS5iio&t=2s) | [Repo](https://github.com/thartka/icd_to_ais) |

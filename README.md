## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is **[Charbel Marche](www.charbelmarche.com)** (@charbelmarche33)!

ðŸŽ“ I am a student physician and computer scientist completing my M.D. and M.S. in Data Science at the University of Virginia.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in applications of software engineering, AI, and machine learning in medicine, medical research, investing, and space technology.

ðŸŒ± I am part of teams developing various tools and research projects, some of which I hope interest you:

| Project Name | Project Website | Description | Videos | Organization |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| **NovaCards.AI** | [novacards.ai](https://novacards.ai) | Co-founder of NovaCards.ai, a 2025 434 Accelerator Participant, 2022 UVA Entrepreneurship-Cup finalist, and 2022 UVA I-Corps participant. NovaCards.ai is an ML and NLP-powered web app built by a team of student doctors to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of studying. It empowers users to quickly create and find relevant flashcards, generate pertinent practice questions, and other study materials based on lecture notes and materials. | [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@novacards9634) | [NovaCards.ai GitHub Org](https://github.com/NovaCards) |
| **Anesthesia & ICU Paper Chart Digitization** | [Publication](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.09.25321925v1) | Collaborated with a team to develop a standardized, computer vision-ready anesthesia paper chart aimed at facilitating digital data access in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The project involved creating a chart with predefined categorical checkboxes and structured input fields to improve digitization accuracy. The updated computer vision software demonstrated high detection accuracy for vital signs and physiological indicators. | No Demos Yet | [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Paper-Chart-Extraction-Project) |
| **Pituitary Auto-Segmentation and Normal Space Generation** | Not Publicly Hosted | Engaged in a research project focusing on developing accurate and automated methods for detecting and segmenting pituitary tumors using deep learning techniques. The study aimed to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes for patients with pituitary tumors by utilizing advanced imaging analysis. | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KQH_AVEgxL1WxFkBLFipscPt-cu1cxSglMYK5p6pcy0/edit?usp=sharing) | [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Pituitary-Normal-Space) |
| **StockScrapers.com** | [stockscrapers.com](https://stockscrapers.com) | StockScrapers is a collection of investing tools that empower retail investors to make informed decisions in the stock market. These tools allow users to simulate different investment strategies, facilitate financial modeling for publicly traded corporations, and compare historical financial statements for multiple companies. | [Playlist of Demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BC2CBAGCAQ&list=PLzmWbxNwcvi_1tUU0Ntrkh-9HFDHCt-JO) | [StockScrapers GitHub Org](https://github.com/StockScrapers) | 
| **Stock Financial Statement Retriever From SEC** | [API Home (RapidAPI)](https://rapidapi.com/charbelmarche33-m9pHgx2tG/api/stock-financial-statement-retriever-from-sec) | The StockScrapersâ„¢ Stock Financial Statement Retriever API provides updated and complete access to 10-K financial statement records as reported to the SEC. Our API contains data for 7,171 tickers that report to the SEC, organized by year and financial statement. The data includes all fields reported in the income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements dating back to 2003, as well as company names and URLs pointing to the data sources. | No Demos Yet | [StockScrapers GitHub Org](https://github.com/StockScrapers) |
| **IR Quality Improvement Dashboard** | Not Publicly Hosted | A quality improvement project with UVA Health's Interventional Radiology department. Collaborated with Jordan Bagnall, a fellow medical student, and other staff at UVA Health under the guidance of Dr. John Angle. The project displays adverse event frequencies, severity, and types for various IR procedures over 15 years at UVA for specific patient demographics. The long-term vision is to build a tool similar to the NSQIP calculator to predict complication risks for patients undergoing procedures using machine learning. | [Short Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeUTLHmubnU&t=1s) | No Organization or Public Repo |
| **ICD to AIS/ISS Medical Coding Converter** | [Publication](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2356663) | Abstract accepted into the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine and presented at the SAEM 2023 conference. Also presented at the UVA Medical Student Research Symposium and MSSRP Summer Research Presentation Session in 2022, and the Research Computing Poster Exhibition in 2024. Worked with Dr. Hartka, an EM doctor and data scientist, to create and train various neural networks to predict appropriate Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes for trauma patients based on the ICD codes assigned during hospital stays. Developed using PyTorch. | [Recorded Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HofUtHS5iio&t=2s) | [Repo](https://github.com/thartka/icd_to_ais) |
